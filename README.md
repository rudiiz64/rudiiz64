# Hi there, I'm Rodolfo Zaragoza! ðŸ˜„

I'm an Electrical Engineer who's interest lie in digital hardware and embedded systems. I currently design PCBs and drivers as a hobby to hone my personal skill set to potentially apply those skills in the aerospace or medical industry.
I will always pursue things to learn and ways to improve my skills to better the products I work on to ensure they are meeting the needs of the users and are products I am proud to produce.
