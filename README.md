# Hi there, I'm Rodolfo Zaragoza! ðŸ˜„

I'm an Electrical Engineer who's interest lie in hardware and embedded systems. I am currently looking to get into working with hardware design, as I enjoy working with CAD tools to layout PCBs along with programming boards with microcontrollers and/or FPGAs. My current hobbies consist of designing PCBs and drivers to hone my personal skill set to potentially apply those skills in the Electrical Engineering field.
I will always pursue things to learn and ways to improve my skills to better the products I work on to ensure they are meeting the needs of the users and are products I am proud to produce.

### **_Tools and Languages_**
