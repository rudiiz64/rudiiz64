# Hi there, I'm Rodolfo Zaragoza! ðŸ˜„

I'm an Electrical Engineer who's interest lie in digital hardware and embedded systems. I am currently looking to get into the ASIC field, as I enjoy working with FPGAs and am well versed in Verilog. My current hobbies consist of designing PCBs and drivers to hone my personal skill set to potentially apply those skills in the Electrical Engineering field.
I will always pursue things to learn and ways to improve my skills to better the products I work on to ensure they are meeting the needs of the users and are products I am proud to produce.

### **_Tools and Languages_**
